# Visualization basics
>"Data visualization is the graphical display of abstract information for two purposes: sense-making (also called data analysis) and communication."  

>   -_Stephen Few, [What is Data Visualization](https://www.perceptualedge.com/blog/?p=2636)_


This workshop emphasizes the role data visualization plays in the two activities identified above. Visualization makes it easier to explore and understand what's going on in our data, fulfilling the **sense-making** purpose. It can also improve the **communication** of our findings by drawing attention to the patterns, relationships, and stories we choose to highlight.

Data visualizations are often attractive, but it isn't primarily their visual appeal that makes them work. A chart or graph that communicates effectively taps into the processes of perception and cognition. To create and recognize good visualizations it will help to understand a few concepts.

## Preattentive processing
The first is **preattentive processing**, which refers to the eye and brain's ability to process certain visual properties almost instantly, without conscious effort. Good graphs take advantage of this perceptual ability to make information almost immediately apparent with little cost to the viewer. This figure shows the preattentive visual attributes that are especially useful when visualizing data.

In the figure above it is easy to spot the differences: some of them pop out almost instantly, with no need to concentrate or look closely. When creating visualizations we can take advantage of these preattentive attributes to encode information, often using more than one in the same graph.

It is also clear from the figure that preattentive attributes have different powers. Some stand out more than others, and some can be used not only to distinguish _between_ things (like shape), but to show differences in _amount_ (like length). All of this may sound obvious, but that is precisely the point: visual cues that are obvious to most viewers we make it easier for them to see - and hopefully understand - the messages we want our visualizations to convey.

## Encoding quantities
Length and size are two preattentive attributes often used to represent quantities.

## Reducing distractions
By minimizing non-data ink we can call the viewer's attention to what matters in a visual display. This applies to graphs as well as tables, but the tabular example below illustrates the point.

In the version on the left the data is encased in lines that are not required to . There is enough space between columns to make the table legible without vertical lines. The horizontal lines help viewers scan from left to right, but this is done just as easily with thinner, lighter lines. The result is a table that is. 

Apply similar methods when creating visualizations. Ask whether each visual element is necessary and keep only those that contribute to the message or the readability of your work. 

## Some guiding principles 
1. **Choose clarity over variety** (there are many simple bar graphs in my work, because they communicate clearly)
2. **Reduce burden on the reader** (avoid distractions and unecessary information, help the reader focus on your message)
3. **Present data with integrity** (even if biased, we can be honest about what we present, our sources, and our methods)
