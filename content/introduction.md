# Dashboard basics
>"A dashboard is a visual display of the most important information needed to achieve one or more objectives; consolidated and arranged on a single screen so the information can be monitored at a glance"  

>   -_Stephen Few, [Information Dashboard Design](http://resolve.library.ubc.ca/cgi-bin/catsearch?bid=5955120)_


The term _dashboard_ is often used loosely to describe visual displays of information. Visualization consultant and author Stephen Few's narrower definition highlights several distinguishing characteristics of effective dashboards. A good dashboard:

- Displays information **visually**
- Has a clear sense of **purpose**
- Fits on one **screen**

The dashboard metaphor refers to the display found in cars or airplane cockpits. They provide information a driver or pilot can monitor at a glance to operate the vehicle safely. Information that must be acted on quickly needs to stand out, such as the light indicating a near-empty fuel tank. In a business environment a dashboard might provide a regular snapshot of activities and call attention to areas that need attention (e.g. because of an unexpected change). 

In _Tableau_ software the term _dashboard_ is used more broadly. It refers to a display that combines graphs from multiple Tableau _sheets_. A user may create several tables or graphs - each on its own sheet - then combine them in a display with labels and other elements. Some Tableau dashboards are similar in function to the dashboards of vehicles; others are like infographics or interactive reports that tell a story or provide visual access to a dataset.

Whether you're creating an interactive visual report or a dashboard for continuous monitoring, clarity about purpose and audience will help you decide what to include and how to present it well. 

## Some guidelines for effective dashboards 
I draw from Stephen Few's [Information Dashboard Design: the Effective Visual Communication of Data](http://resolve.library.ubc.ca/cgi-bin/catsearch?bid=5955120) and Alberto Cairo's [How Charts Lie: Getting Smarter about Visual Information](http://resolve.library.ubc.ca/cgi-bin/catsearch?bid=10081648) to offer a short list of guidelines for dashboard design.

### Provide sufficient context
> "Don't trust chart authors and publishers who don't mention the sources of their data or who don't link directly to them."

>   -_Alberto Cairo, How Charts Lie, p.l05_

If you want viewers to trust your reports be upfront about the data they are based on. This is standard practice an academic environments but is sometimes overlooked when dashboards or visualizations are presented independently. In addition to citing your data source, make sure you provide enough context for a viewer to interpret the dashboard correctly. The right amount of contextual information may depend on your intended purpose and audience.
 
### Nothing unnecessary 
The visual field can become cluttered quickly, whether because of unnecessary decorative elements that do not contribute to the message or information that is not relevant to the dashboard's main purpose. It is helpful to ask whether each element in a dashboard contributes to the intended use. A grah may be attractive or interesting in its own right, but not a good fit for a particular dashboard. This also applies on a smaller level: avoid labels that provide more precision than you need as they take up space and attention (e.g. don't use _2.073%_ where _2.1%_ is close enough).

### Appropriate chart types
More on this to come

### Appealing arrangement 

> "Well-designed charts aren't just informative but also graceful and, like a good turn of phrase, sometimes even playful and surprising."
