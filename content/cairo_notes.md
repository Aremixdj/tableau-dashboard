#Notes from Alberto Cairo's "How charts lie" book

- The book is about how to become a better chart reader, because charts can empower us but they can also mislead if we don't know how to interpret them.

- p2: "when presented alone and devoid of context, this map can be misleading

## hastily recreated notes lost earlier

- progression examples in p26-29 may be a good example to follow, choose a dataset where participants can do something simple that then leads them further.

- p11 "charts may lie because they display either the wrong information or too little information. However, a chart can show the right type and amount of information and lie anyway due to poor design or labelling.

- terms "scaffolding" and "content" may be useful, introduced on p24.

- p15, possibly an example where decorative non-data ink can add confusion (the fruits taken as literal)

- p40ish, idea that we have mental models for graphs/charts of different types (e.g. know what a line graph should look like, what a scatter plot should look like). In general it makes sense to follow these conventions (e.g. to plot time on the horizontal in a line graph).

- p46. The three-part grammer of charts, including symbols, visual encodings, and text. Might be a good mental model to use when developing the content. 

- Think back to carpentries training and consider the mental model for what you're trying to impart. Everything you teach should probably belong on a mental model of some kind, otherwise it might not be worth teaching. Find the 2-3 models that will tie things together and put them up front in the material. One might be the visual language, one might be the motivation (and the right-motivation) and a final one might be the mental model for how Tableau works with the data.

- p47. "Well-designed charts aren't just informative but also graceful and, like a good turn of phrase, sometimes even playful and surprising." Needs to be something in this material that conveys excitement and possibility, connectedness to the subject matter, not just the nuts and bolts of making the software work.

- p47. "A good chart isn't an illustration but a visual argument or part of an argument."

- p50, an excellent passage on why some good graphs are complex and require some attention from the reader, and why this is ok (some stories are complex). The important thing is not to make it more complex than it needs to be from lack of design knowledge, or "for no good reason."

- p51, summary list of ways that charts can lie.

- p61, why the baseline needs to be zero in bar charts but doesn't have to be in line charts. Short answer: in a line the encodings are position and angle, neither of which changes if the baseline changes(as long as the baseline does not cut off some of the data).

- p67, another good example of why a blanket "all charts start at zero" rule is not true in all cases - climate change example where starting at zero distorts.

- p95, "charts rarely prove anything"
- p105, "don't trust chart authors who don't mention the source of their data."-
