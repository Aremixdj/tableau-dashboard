## Acknowledgements
This workshop draws on and references the work of consultant and educator [Stephen Few](http://www.perceptualedge.com/about.php) and journalist [Alberto Cairo](http://albertocairo.com) (see also the  [Resources](content/resources.html) page).

The sample data consists of two files from the [Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Cases Data](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-cases) compiled by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CCSE). The files were downloaded Jan 27, 2021 and the second header rows were removed to facilitate import into Tableau:
- time_series_covid19_confirmed_global_narrow.csv
- time_series_covid19_deaths_global_narrow.csv
