<h2>Tableau Public</h2>

<aside class="notes">

<p>This workshop uses <em>Tableau Public</em> software to introduce data visualization concepts because it is freely available and accessible to beginners.</p>

<p>This is not an endorsement of Tableau: there are many options for data visualization and other software may be better in other contexts. While suitable as a teaching tool, <em>Tableau Public</em> imposes limitations that users should be aware of:</p>

</aside>

<ul>
  <li>Visualizations cannot be saved locally</li>
  <li>Dataset limit of 1M records</li>
  <li>Cannot connect databases</li>
</ul>

<p class="small"><em>Tableau Desktop</em> is available in the Digital Scholarship Lab (<a href="https://remotelabs.ubc.ca">https://remotelabs.ubc.ca</a>)</p>

<p>“Data visualization is the graphical display of abstract information for two purposes: sense-making (also called data analysis) and communication.”</p>

<p>-<em>Stephen Few, <a href="https://www.perceptualedge.com/blog/?p=2636">What is Data Visualization</a></em></p>

<aside class="notes">

<p>This workshop emphasizes the role data visualization plays in the two activities identified above. Visualization makes it easier to explore and understand what’s going on in our data, fulfilling the <strong>sense-making</strong> purpose. It can also improve the <strong>communication</strong> of our findings by drawing attention to the patterns, relationships, and stories we choose to highlight.</p>

<p>Data visualizations are often attractive, but it isn’t primarily their visual appeal that makes them work. A chart or graph that communicates effectively taps into the processes of perception and cognition. To create and recognize good visualizations it will help to understand a few concepts.</p>

<h2>Preattentive processing</h2>

<aside class="notes">

<p>The eye and brain’s ability to process certain visual properties almost instantly, without conscious effort.</p>

</aside>

<section>

<p><img src="images/preattentive_attributes.png"><br>
<em>Source: Stephen Few, “Tapping the Power of Visual Perception” <a href="http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/ie/visual_perception.pdf">http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/ie/visual_perception.pdf</a></em></p>

<p>Good graphs take advantage of this perceptual ability to make information almost immediately apparent with little cost to the viewer. This figure shows the preattentive visual attributes that are especially useful when visualizing data.<br>
In the figure above it is easy to spot the differences: some of them pop out almost instantly, with no need to concentrate or look closely. When creating visualizations we can take advantage of these preattentive attributes to encode information, often using more than one attribute in the same graph.</p>

<p>It is also clear from the figure that preattentive attributes have different powers. Some stand out more than others, and some can be used not only to distinguish <em>between</em> things (like shape), but to show differences in <em>amount</em> (like length). All of this may sound obvious, but that is precisely the point: by using visual cues that are obvious to most viewers we make it easier for them to see - and hopefully understand - the messages we want our visualizations to convey.<br>
```</p>

<p>Remove unneceassary content to keep the viewer focused</p>

<aside class="notes">

<p>When using visualizations to communicate it is good practice to remove elements that are not required to convey your message. Additional labels, lines, and decimal points compete for the viewers attention and can distract from what matters most in a visual display. It is important to provide enough detail for the viewer to orient themselves and understand the graph, but removing unecessary components provides more breathing room and helps the viewer focus on the content.<br>
In the version on the right, removing redundant text and changing text shading, placement, and size draws attention to the main content: unemployment rates. Unecessary lines are also removed. The light horizontal lines are sometimes helpful when scanning across a graph and were kept, but even these might not be necessary in all cases.</p>

<p>In your own work review each visual component and ask whether it helps keep the viewer focused. The “less is more” rule often leads to clearer visualizations.</p>

<h2>Using color</h2>
<p>Use colors intentionally to <strong>encode information</strong></p>

<aside class="notes">

<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Colorblindness</strong>. Avoid encoding important information in colors that may be difficult for some viewers to perceive. See <a href="https://www.tableau.com/about/blog/2016/4/examining-data-viz-rules-dont-use-red-green-together-53463">5 tips on designing colorblind-friendly visualizations</a>.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Visual continuity</strong>. A dashboard or report may contain several visualizations based on the same data. If the same category appears in several graphs use the same color scheme to depict it throughout. This will make it easier for viewers see the relationship among your graphs.</li>
  <li>
<strong>Meaningful encoding</strong>. The colors on the left below do not encode any new information and add distracting visual complexity to the graph. By not “spending” colors unnecessarily designers can use them to greater effect (e.g. to call attention to a particular value).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Some guiding principles</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Choose clarity over variety</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Reduce burden on the reader</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Present data with integrity</strong></li>
</ol>

<aside class="notes">

<p>Visual variety can be appealing, but ensure that it also serves the communicative and sense-making purposes of your visualizations.<br>
The twin graphs above illustrate this point. Avoid distractions and unecessary information and help the reader focus on the content.<br>
We increase the credibility and integrity of our work by citing data sources and avoiding intentionally misleading displays. (For more about this see Alberto Cairo’s book <a href="http://resolve.library.ubc.ca/cgi-bin/catsearch?bid=10081648"><em>How charts lie : getting smarter about visual information.</em></a>)</p>

<h2>Preparing your data</h2>

<aside class="notes">

<p>This workshop emphasizes the visualization but in many cases your data will need to be manipulated, reformatted, and re-packaged <em>before</em> you feed it to a visualization tool. Tableau (and other visualization tools) have some features to help clean messy data, but here are some general things to consider when preparing your data.</p>

<h2>Each measure in one column</h2>

<aside class="notes">

<p>If you’re working with tabular data (e.g. Excel, csv), format it so that each measure appears in one column only. A table like this will be harder to work with and will have fewer visualization options than this table with the same information:</p>

</aside>

<h2>Remove non-data content</h2>

<aside class="notes">

<p>Excel worksheets often begin with titles and other information, with the actual data starting below. Subtitles and empty lines within the data table may further interfere with visualization software’s ability to interpret the contents. Removing extra lines and non-data content is a good general practice, though Tableau can often identify the data elements correctly during import.</p>

</aside>

<h2>Know your dataset</h2>
<ul>
  <li>How is it formatted?</li>
  <li>How many records are there?</li>
  <li>What are the variable labels?</li>
  <li>Is there a user guide or data dictionary?</li>
</ul>

<aside class="notes">

<p>It’s important to know a few things about your data before importing it. How many records are there? What are the variable labels? Knowing this will help you confirm that Tableau imported the data correctly.</p>

<p>The sample dataset for this workshop contains four months of data from the Statistics Canada Labour Force Survey (Jan, Apr, Jul, and Oct 2020).

<h2>Variables in sample dataset</h2>

<aside class="notes">

<p>To make it easier to work with in Tableau the sample dataset is a modified subset of the original data. Some variables were excluded and variable names and values were replaced with descriptive labels (see the <a href="resources.html">Resources</a> page for details about the changes). The dataset contains 360,554 observations of 23 variables:</p>
